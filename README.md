Fae is originally based on [pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) but with a focus on WebGL
and a few core design differences that result in a familiar but slightly different API.

Fae is meant to be a highly modular rendering framework. The primary target use-case for Fae is
to be easily intregrable into larger application frameworks. However, the plugin library for Fae
enables it to be useful to end users as well as a standalone framework.

## Support

Developing Fae takes a lot of time and effort. The multiple services and servers that run for
the Fae project cost a non-trivial amount of money. If you want to help support the continued
development of Fae, please consider making a donation.

There are a couple ways you can have an impact:

- A monthly contribution via Patreon (Coming Soon).
- A donation via PayPal: [![PayPal](https://img.shields.io/badge/paypal-donate-yellow.svg)][paypal-donate]

All donations go right back into the Fae community in the form of server hosting, and development
time.
